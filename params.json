{"google":"","name":"git-lp","body":"About\r\n=====\r\n\r\ngit-lp is a tool that allows you to use git to work with Launchpad.net.\r\n\r\nTutorial\r\n========\r\n\r\nMake sure to see the tutorial that is built right into git-lp with:\r\n\r\n    $ git lp tutorial\r\n\r\nNow back to the web edition! Create a new repository for working with\r\na single Launchpad.net project:\r\n\r\n    $ git lp init checkbox && cd checkbox\r\n\r\nGet the initial code from Launchpad.net. This can be accelerated if you have an\r\nexisting bzr branch somewhere (pass the --cache option)\r\n\r\n    $ git lp fetch\r\n\r\nStart working on a feature/bug in a dedicated branch:\r\n\r\n    $ git lp branch feature-foo\r\n\r\nWhile you want:\r\n - Hack on your code\r\n - Commit with git\r\n - Rebase, squash, etc\r\n\r\nAt any time you can push your branch to Launchpad.net for reviews. This will\r\npush the code to lp:~yourlaunchpadusername/project/feature-foo.\r\n\r\n    $ git lp push\r\n\r\nYou can easily react to review feedback: commit new patches, rework and amend\r\nexisting patches, anything that you want to. Once you are ready share your code\r\nagain just run push again. You may need to pass --overwrite to push if you've\r\nbeen rewriting history though (but that is okay as you're working on a merge\r\nrequest and it has not yet landed)\r\n\r\n    $ git lp push --overwrite\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal with bzr trunk but I believe it\r\nshould apply cleanly to packaged versions as well.\r\n\r\n1. Download https://raw.github.com/zyga/git-lp/master/bzr.patch \r\n2. Apply it to your system (reinstall bzr to revert)\r\n\r\n    You may want to read the outcome of this merge request to know if this\r\n    patch has been accepted or well reviewed by the Bazaar maintainers. Once\r\n    this is fixed then you won't have to patch your bzr anymore obviously.\r\n\r\n    https://code.launchpad.net/~zkrynicki/bzr/find_ancestors/+merge/127610\r\n\r\n3. Put git-lp (https://raw.github.com/zyga/git-lp/master/git-lp) somewhere in\r\n   your PATH.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
